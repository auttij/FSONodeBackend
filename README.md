# FSONodeBackend
app running in: http://secure-bastion-91187.herokuapp.com/

This repository contains my submission for the part 3 of the course [Fullstack open](https://fullstackopen.com/). It has been separated to it's own repository to allow ease of use with Heroku.

The frontend used in this application is available [here](https://github.com/auttij/FullStackOpen/tree/master/osa2/puhelinluettelo)
